# Recipe Revolution (RRNX)

The project consisted of an iOS app, pictures, where it was crucial to have recipes to create.  Gluten allergies and the need to find more options was specifically the prior design put forward as the societal fix.

Created, designed and developed to launch to the Apple App Store,  Two doctors put to task a UX team that created wireframes, research and prototypes.

Despite having a solid start, the Apple store data revealed an immediate need to  manage uninstalls.


## Problem

This project was mid-cycle. What numerous steps are also hold-ups for the user? Critical for the stakeholder was to lay down disclaimers everywhere. So, how might it look to a gluten-free user to get caught up in that process?  Casual exploration many of us do in a newly installed app was taking unreasonably long. Glancing at the food pictures, you see they are outdated.
