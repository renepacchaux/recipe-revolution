# Recipe Revolution
## Case Study on a recipe substitution app
Want to cook gluten free?, how do you get a recipe substitution to happen at your fingertips? This is a breakaway app that intends to improve the lives of people living with health restrictions. For a diet restriction as severe as Celiac disease, is there way to remove the complexity of rebuilding you favorite iteration of pizza?

Because onboarding is a chance to directly engage the individual on how the app is to be used, learnability comes up as a key design principle. A diet-tip seeking individual uninstalls because they have just arrived at an app that otherwise requires more personal help on how to use it. 

### Problem
How could we increase uptake of users onto the app?

### Solution
We applied research the learnability principle for focusing into the app onboarding process. The time it takes to learn an app requires motivation.

But there are no shortcuts to excitement. It has to work better and faster.


## ‍Initial State Strategy
- Users with gluten allergies can apply a known common recipe to get back a gluten-free recipe with proper food substitutions.

## Design Workflow
We have a chance to present with XD so here it is: https://xd.adobe.com/view/038ea04b-be9b-42a8-8b5a-e1c9f1537b96-56dd/?fullscreen

No doubt that visual representation, even lightly doodling on blank pages, help with the mental model needed to have a problem-centered design narrative.
