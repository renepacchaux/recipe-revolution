# Recipe Revolution
Because onboarding is a chance to directly engage the individual on how the app is to be used, learnability comes up as a key design principle. A diet-tip seeking individual uninstalls because they have just arrived at an app that otherwise requires more personal help on how to use it. Encapsulated in what makes this process special, is that serious consideration for extremely life-changing or life-dependent recipe adjustments. 

## Solution
We applied research the learnability principle for focusing into the app onboarding process.
The time to learn an app requires some reserve of motivation or excitement.

But there are no shortcuts to the solution.

I like to use svgs. Above I only shoe the first two sections of a flow but I can follow the line to line on the emotional hypothesis I am building.

We have a chance to present with XD so here it is: https://xd.adobe.com/view/038ea04b-be9b-42a8-8b5a-e1c9f1537b96-56dd/?fullscreen)

Even redesigns need to respect a thinking with a clean slate.  I explore cleaning up a bit to get the device not so much shiny, but remove assumptions.  Unaligned features turn into dashed dreams later.

No doubt that visual representation, even lightly doodling on blank pages, help with the mental model needed to have a problem-centered design narrative.
