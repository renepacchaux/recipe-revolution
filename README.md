# Recipe Revolution

The project consisted of an iOS app, pictures, and recipes to create.  If one comes down with gluten allergies and need to find more options, or specifically, to make your own brand of gluten-free meals, this was your fix.

App was created, designed and developed to launch to the Apple App Store by two doctors. I was part of a UX team that created wireframes and prototypes post-initial any initial deploy.

Despite having a solid backing, the pair where now busy trying to manage uninstalls.


# Problem

I participated in this project mid-cycle overall. I wanted to know what numerous steps, if any, were becoming hold-ups for the user. If it was important for the stakeholder to lay down disclaimers everywhere, how might a gluten-free user get stuck in that process?  What casual exploration of the app it takes longer than it should reasonably take?  At first glance, I could see the pictures aren't up to date. We start with a hypothetical of a person at home, yet busy, who decides to take on this exploratory challenge over just googling a solution.


# Solution

The players in this mid-cycle project are photos and exploration.  How might I use these as attention-takers to generate more engagement (and less uninstalls)?


# Research

Take this scenario: User is busy and only has just enough motivation to make their own recipe through exploration.  Does a 'gram-style' presentation have the same attention drains? To distinguish itself, Recipe Revolution addresses the immediate need that is tied in with the desire to explore new and interesting recipes.


# Design

Using pictures helps us to explore recipes.  If we think to flows of other recipe apps, we know this to be true.  Disclaimers, on the other hand, lures-me not. Recipes let you learn how to put it all together in the kitchen. Initially, the work made the team hungry. Contributing a first recipe needed to be just as intuitive.


# What do Disclaimers do?

Low hanging fruit alert:

-   Combine sessions for disclaimers.
-   Let the priority remain learning to use the app.

Disclaimers inform less than they 'disclaim.'  To let the user move forward, what if we temporarily delivered just enough trust.  The app was already created by two doctors. Why does the app feel like you need to approve and re-approve post exploration buy-in?

The busy structures of people's lives when cooking are of constantly doing two things at a time.


# Better Pictures

The user doesn't think about this overtly. Onboarding means: Get the user to upload **while** they are onboarding.  Part of the visual design was a picture sketch depicting exactly this first part of the process on mobile.  The sketch part also brought to light the what-if a user does not take the path all the way to a finally-cooked product. Interaction with the app can be pictures.


# Exploration

For visual learners, a priority is to have the user upload images as part of the onboarding process. The first user input become self-perpetuating. The final plan consisted of a wireframe and userflow, yet the fun was in telling us what the product needed to keep the user exploring.

Cut down the time required to learn the various steps.

Every photo becomes normal food-photo lighting plays a role for user exploration.


# Conclusion

With the newly-installed app, cook something from scratch.  If you got that far, trying splitting up your work into following a recipe. It is important to address this effort because patience is limited.

In the span of 3 weeks, onboarding  meant awareness of time within short deadlines, while questioning motivations for repetitious tasks.
