The project consisted of an iOS app, pictures, where it was crucial to have recipes to create.  Gluten allergies and the need to find more options was specifically the prior design put forward as the societal fix.

Created, designed and developed to launch to the Apple App Store,  Two doctors put to task a UX team that created wireframes, research and prototypes.

Despite having a solid start, the Apple store data revealed an immediate need to  manage uninstalls.


# Problem

This project was mid-cycle. What numerous steps are also hold-ups for the user? Critical for the stakeholder was to lay down disclaimers everywhere. So, how might it look to a gluten-free user to get caught up in that process?  Casual exploration many of us do in a newly installed app was taking unreasonably long. Glancing at the food pictures, you see they are outdated.


# Solution

The research let us to this:  A person at home, busy, who decides to take on cooking a recipe with a substitution.

"Why not just googling it?" - a user test interviewee

If the main players in this project are photos and exploration, how might I use generate more engagement (and less uninstalls)? Is the attention to disclaimers justified or obtrusive given the circumstances?

User is busy with just enough motivation to make their own recipe.  Where is the presentation that distinguishes Recipe Revolution from an Instagram with the same information?  Does the current app library of recipes give enought impetus to explore new and strange yet delicious meals?

# Design

Decision 1: Using pictures helps us to explore recipes.

If we think to flows of other recipe apps, we know this to be true.  Disclaimers, on the other hand, lures-me not. Recipes let you learn how to put it all together in the kitchen. Initially, the work made the team hungry. Contributing a first recipe needed to be just as intuitive.


# What do Disclaimers do?

Low hanging fruit alert:

-   Combine sessions for disclaimers.
-   Let the priority remain learning to use the app.

Disclaimers inform less than they 'disclaim.'  To let the user move forward, what if we temporarily delivered just enough trust.  The app was already created by two doctors. Why does the app feel like you need to approve and re-approve post exploration buy-in?

The busy structures of people's lives when cooking are of constantly doing two things at a time.


# Better Pictures

The user doesn't think about this overtly. Onboarding means: Get the user to upload **while** they are onboarding.  Part of the visual design was a picture sketch depicting exactly this first part of the process on mobile.  The sketch part also brought to light the what-if a user does not take the path all the way to a finally-cooked product. Interaction with the app can be pictures.


# Exploration

For visual learners, a priority is to have the user upload images as part of the onboarding process. The first user input become self-perpetuating. The final plan consisted of a wireframe and userflow, yet the fun was in telling us what the product needed to keep the user exploring.

Cut down the time required to learn the various steps.

Every photo becomes normal food-photo lighting plays a role for user exploration.


# Conclusion

With the newly-installed app, cook something from scratch.  If you got that far, trying splitting up your work into following a recipe. It is important to address this effort because patience is limited.

In the span of 3 weeks, onboarding  meant awareness of time within short deadlines, while questioning motivations for repetitious tasks.
