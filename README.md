# Recipe Revolution
## UX on a recipe mobile app
A mobile app improving a life with health restrictions. How do you remove the complexity?

Because onboarding is a chance to directly engage the individual on how the app is to be used, they ask "Does it work for me?" but may abruptly uninstall because they have just arrived at an app that requires 'onboarding.'

### Project Challenge
How could we increase uptake and retention of users onto the app?

We planned interview research and among the feedback was to ask where their excitement went after downloading the app?  I information was in pieces at first until we notices the subtle theme that every interviewee _wanted_ a recipe converter.
We applied research the learnability principle for focusing into the app onboarding process. The time it takes to learn an app requires motivation.

But there are no shortcuts to excitement. It has to work better and faster.

#### ‍Initial Strategy
Through writing out some of our assumptions, where where also able to write an interview guide to test our Low-Risk asssumptions when communicating with our stakeholders.  We agreed that on some level, we wanted users with gluten allergies can apply a known common recipe to get back a gluten-free recipe with proper food substitutions, using this app.

No doubt that visual representation, even lightly doodling on blank pages, help with the mental model needed to have a problem-centered design narrative.
