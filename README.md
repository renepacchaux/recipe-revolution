# Recipe Revolution
## Recipe App Overview
A mobile app improving a life with health restrictions

Abrupt uninstalls needed addressing. 

### Project Challenge
For a dietary-restrictive informational app, how could address target users in a more direct way?

#### Background

Every person we interviewed _wanted_ this to work. This app, created by two doctors, did the work of crunching recipe number to get you a _gluten-free_ result.  There are hurdles, but those obstacles lay at the moment the app is installed -- requiring the user to do the bulk of the learning.  The user had a lot of work to do immediately after install.

#### Why Learnability?
Our issue was that our user had to learn a lot just to get started.  If the user can learn quickly, that is great.  If we can remove some obstacles -- even better.

#### Goals & Objectives
Can we get the number of clicks to input a recipe down to some very small number -- yet implement an "onboarding" feature as required by the product owner?  We set out to imagine more than one user to represent who we are trying to serve, in a very targeted way.


#### ‍Initial Strategy

We planned interview research and among the feedback was to ask where their excitement went after downloading the app?  I information was in pieces at first until we notices the subtle theme thate converter.
We applied research the learnability principle for focusing into the app onboarding process. The time it takes to learn an app requires motivation.

But there are no shortcuts to excitement. It has to work better and faster.
Through writing out some of our assumptions, where where also able to write an interview guide to test our Low-Risk asssumptions when communicating with our stakeholders.  We agreed that on some level, we wanted users with gluten allergies can apply a known common recipe to get back a gluten-free recipe with proper food substitutions, using this app.


We have a chance to present with XD so here it is: https://xd.adobe.com/view/038ea04b-be9b-42a8-8b5a-e1c9f1537b96-56dd/?fullscreen

No doubt that visual representation, even lightly doodling on blank pages, help with the mental model needed to have a problem-centered design narrative.
