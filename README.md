## What we are trying to learn

### A recipe app

A mobile app improving a life with health restrictions Abrupt uninstalls
needed addressing.

**Project Challenge**

For a dietary-restrictive informational app, how could address target
users in a more direct way?

**Background**

Every person we interviewed *wanted* this to work. This app, created by
two doctors, did the work of crunching recipe number to get you a
*gluten-free* result. There are hurdles, but those obstacles lay at the
moment the app is installed &#x2013; requiring the user to do the bulk of the
learning. The user had a lot of work to do immediately after install.

**Why Learnability?**

Our issue was that our user had to learn a lot just to get started. If
the user can learn quickly, that is great. If we can remove some
obstacles &#x2013; even better.

## Goals & Objectives

Can we get the number of clicks to input a recipe down to some very
small number &#x2013; yet implement an "onboarding" feature as required by the
product owner? We set out to imagine more than one user to represent who
we are trying to serve, in a very targeted way.

**The Meat of Our Strategy**

We planned interview research and among the feedback was to ask where
their excitement went after downloading the app? I information was in
pieces at first until we notices the subtle theme thate converter.

We applied research the learnability principle for focusing into the app
onboarding process. The time it takes to learn an app requires
motivation. But there are no shortcuts to excitement. It has to work
better and faster.

Through writing out some of our assumptions, where where also able to
write an interview guide to test our Low-Risk asssumptions when
communicating with our stakeholders. We agreed that on some level, we
wanted users with gluten allergies can apply a known common recipe to
get back a gluten-free recipe with proper food substitutions, using this
app.

No doubt that visual representation, even lightly doodling on blank
pages, help with the mental model needed to have a problem-centered
design narrative. ‚Äç
