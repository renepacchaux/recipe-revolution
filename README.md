# Recipe Revolution
## Case Study on a recipe substitution app
Want to cook gluten free?, how do you get a recipe substitution to happen at your fingertips? This mobile app that intends to improve  living with health restrictions. How do you remove the complexity?

Because onboarding is a chance to directly engage the individual on how the app is to be used, learnability comes up as a key design principle. A diet-tip seeking individual uninstalls because they have just arrived at an app that otherwise requires more personal help on how to use it. 

### Problem
How could we increase uptake of users onto the app?

### Solution
We applied research the learnability principle for focusing into the app onboarding process. The time it takes to learn an app requires motivation.

But there are no shortcuts to excitement. It has to work better and faster.

## ‍Initial Strategy
- Through writing out some of our assumptions, where where also able to write an interview guide to test our Low-Risk asssumptions when communicating with our stakeholders.  We agreed that on some level, we wanted users with gluten allergies can apply a known common recipe to get back a gluten-free recipe with proper food substitutions, using this app.

## Design Workflow

We have a chance to present with XD so here it is: https://xd.adobe.com/view/038ea04b-be9b-42a8-8b5a-e1c9f1537b96-56dd/?fullscreen

No doubt that visual representation, even lightly doodling on blank pages, help with the mental model needed to have a problem-centered design narrative.
