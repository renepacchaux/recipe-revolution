### Project Challenge

There were too many hurdles to getting the first recipe. I needed that
time to be shorter, to know I made a dent. Apple store analytics showed
abrupt uninstalls. It was clear that if the digital flow were improved
and clicks down to a small number, I could make way for other issues
that needed further addressing.

**UX Designer Thought Process**

How can my work lead to a well-rounded and informed goal? There are many
points I will make about how I came to realize what can be considered a
big deal to the business and the user. I'll also tell you what I did
about it.

The implementation gave me positive vibes. I spotted nuanced evidence of
a seeded approach to the upload meal feature. This case study focuses on
an implicit requirement to get Instagram-style meal selfies on the app
as soon as possible.

I box my time. As a result, my attention to the task is well-boudaried
and the work improved when I had micro-deadlines. In meetings, I did
behind the scenes with a digital set of timers. I prepared estimates of
the amount of time I would take up. I controlled the pace of idea idea
to paper.

**The wrong flow**

For some, gluten intake may improve your life. For others, it is life or
death.

We did not expect to see so many obstacles. Many pixels were dedicated
to warnings about even using the app. This is not what went wrong.
Shifting pixels for legal cookie warnings seems like something easy to
take away. But I identified an implicit requirement: user-uploaded
foodie photos. There were a business requirement and part of the cycle
of decreasing learn times by crowd-converting recipes.

### Research

Many users I interviewed wanted the recipe app to work better. There
being two doctors behind the project was a hit with users as well.

**App Background**

Created by two doctors to get you recipes that were *gluten-free.*

It does not work to be in a kitchen following a recipe off the phone
while checking off disclaimer boxes, learning how to do that, then
learning the original thing again.

Back in the interview with the stakeholder, I got my first glimpse of an
spoken need - onboarding. There was a clear business need that almost
flew under the radar if it were not for imagery in the up-and-running
app.

Let us talk about a physical hurdle. The user's hands are full doing the
cooking, literally. One cannot do much more other than the two things of
cooking and going off a recipe. Our first steps in sketching brought us
towards doing some of the the upfront learning, to scale, for the user
base. When we tested the sketches, we also testing the learning times.

The solution was cut the time-to-conversion steps to a small number.

**Removing obstacles to fast learning**

Userflows are a glimpse into a direction a user can take within the
bounds of the app. To improve time it takes to learn the app, we improve
the user flow.

The business went as far as to seed the application with photos. This
action validates the gap between where the app is now and where the
business wants it to be.

**What I did to start the process**

To get ideas out of my head and onto paper, I had a sketch design
session. In a very imaginative but focused way, I created a
representation of our users. I scheduled time to make a persona. This
ended up turning into two personas.

I connect with the playfulness of the pencil sketches to think freely,
and draw from a high quantity on inspiration. I need to know what to
leave out. Sketching helps with that. According to the testing, some
areas of the visuals were a distraciton.

At a second stakeholder interview, onboarding had stayed on as priority
one. I was able to work with that.

### Design Work

I kept my ideas from surpassing the onboarding requirement, while
keeping the second requirement of user-uploads in the back of my mind. I
downloaded the app like a user would.

I carryed this motivation to all user interviews I planned. At the
actual interviews I stayed on task to finished withing the agreed upon
tim.

There was a disconnect in how the visuals were presented at first
download. At this point, the visuals are increasingly important. It was
all bearing down on representation of the final followed recipe in the
product as shown. Did instagram become and implied competition also?

Isn't instagram fun? What are the design decisions I can make to clarify
to the new user that this will be a clear, snowballing, fun process? Was
fun a requirement per design work?

Interview notes pointed out gluten allergies deep within a food product
as the ingredients are bing put together. It was helpful to see the
finished product, first. We had pictures! There was something very
stylistically similar about the pictures of meals already in the app.
They had similar visual depth and lighting conditions.

Here was our implicit requirement. Get the user to upload a picture.

It has to work better and faster. we assert initial findings through
user testing. Already downloading from the iOS Store, our user still had
many obstacles to go before even thinking of uploading their creation.

An interviewee even said “why not just google it”.

**Process**

One time slot per question answered. That was new process. I would
police my own time per task.

Deadlines and boundaries versus freedom and variability. Time makes an
excellent boundary maker. Physically the digital equivalent is a
pocket-sized portrait rectangle or index card.

**Conclusion**

I stuck to business requirements. I also guaged user-uploads to be an
important marker.

**Summary**

Keep that second perhaps implicit problem in frame as you work to remove
obstacles in an app implementation.
