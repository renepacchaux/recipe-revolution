## Validating visuals

**An already created recipe app**

A mobile app improving a life with health ingredient boundaries. The
work is societally important and so was the launch.

I stepped into this project for an app that was already created. My role
was to improve the UI. Other flows did not have so many hurdles to
finding a user-contributed recipe. I made a point to rid of unnecessary
obstacles soon.

There is was an issue I did not expect. Legalese peppered the app. over
seasoned it for sure. Are legal cookie warnings something to shy away
from? What if the scope of agreements to the user impedes my work to
make it simpler to user. Those work together.

How can my work lead to a well rounded and informed user as the goal?

**Project Challenge**

Will uninstalls decrease?

Tasked with a portion of the inital research, one of the first things I
did was get a user flow drawn. For a recipe creation app, user's needed
their priorities addressed immediately.

In front of me, I had summaries of Apple store analytics metrics
provided. A quick analysis and I was able to spot abrupt uninstalls. It
was clear to me that the flow needed further addressing.

At multiple points, the previous design decisions seemed to focus on
legal protections and warnings, obscuring a critical learning phase of
the app.

I wanted to know more about how it got to this point.

**Background**

This app, created by two doctors, did the work of crunching recipe
numbers to get you a *gluten-free* result.

There are hurdles to recipe making, but those obstacles persist,
physically, at the moment when the app is installed. Our user's hands
are full doing the cooking, literally. I say this is not the best time
to do much more. This requires the user to do the bulk of the learning
at this crucial time.

Two doctors behind the project just speaks to the authentic nature of
putting the health of others first. That was a given. What was not a
give is a requirement that flew under the radar. It was clear a business
need that there had to be user-contributed meal pictures.

Again, the user had a lot of work to do immediately after installing.

Add to that, confirming checkbox legal agreements to put resistance to
divided excitement.

After all, while taking part in the design of questionnaire, I learned
from users I interviewed \*\*that *most actually wanted this recipe app to
work better* for them.

**Fast learners win prizes**

Ok. Our initial issue was that the user had to learn a lot just to get
started. In following this frustration, I diagrammed. My diagrams of the
flow gave me direction on what I might tackle next; to see what is
connected.

If the user can learn quickly, that is great. How do I quantify learning
time? To improve all things app-related, I would like to take away some
of the time it takes for the user to learn the app. Down the line, does
it give us positive vibes to focus on the upload meal as a feature?
After all, I take it as an implicit requirement of the business.

### Roles and Goals

In a very imaginative but focused way i created a representation of our
user. I scheduled time to make a persona. This ended up turning into two
personas.

There are some distinctions to the personas that pointed to a user in a
different category, from the work we did on the thematic board. This is
why we came up with a second user representation.

I need to identify my target. This will help me mentally paint the user.
User is now in my head. It would not live in there forever, though. To
offload those thoughts, Icontribute to the playfulness of the pencil
sketches. I need to room to draw loosely, therefore thinking freely. My
goal is to know what I needed to leave out, as opposed to coral group
ideas in.

I set up a mental test of the number of clicks needed to input a recipe
down to some very small number. Some of the design stuff was indeed a
distraction according the the testing.

As interviewer for a second interview, I took side notes on questions
answered by the app co-founder. The stakeholder wants to implement an
"onboarding" feature. That onboarding feature stayed to this day.

**One Strategy**

I kept in mind what amount of time it takes to learn the app and what
can be put into an onboarding system. The process of going through
onboarding will cost time for the user. I still had a list from the top
of the project. I contributed unfiltered thoughts on the project this
way.

I had planned interview research within a short time span.I incorporated
this into the question guide in preparation for conducting a set of user
interviews.

Implicit image upload was not a thing. At this time “onboarding” was. I
brought follow up questions to the creator on the specifics of the
onboarding requirements. The questions were prepared beforehand.

Following up on better and faster app usage, the time it takes to learn
an app requires motivation *and* time. What are the design decisions I
can make to clarify to the new user that this will be a clear,
snowballing, fun process?

It has to work better and faster while we assert this through user
testing. The user went through the app at certain obstacles, they were
not obstacles anymore. The user's excitement diminished after
downloading from the iOS Store, our user feedback told me.

My notes from that interview also included that users with gluten
allergies wanted to apply a known common recipe to get back a set of
ingredients that could not contain specific items The users needed to
get a fast solution given by the likely circumstances.

There was something very stylistically similar about the picture of
meals added in the app. The app was seeded with a pictures of meals
created under similar visual depth and lighting conditions. We
interviewed the stakeholder briefly. Yes he did do some uploads. Here
was our implicit requirement. There was a measure of certaintly that
this needed to happen, so much so that an attempt to get the ball
rolling was made in that respect.

When I first downloaded the appI had burning questions and wanted to
take a look. I wanted to just to gain a bit of faux-user insight. So, I
became a user, briefly, and downloaded the app.

I noticed a subtle separation in pattern within the recipe calculator.
Was the source of these picture known to one of the co-founders? In
taking a look and breaking up the answers, the interviews also showed me
the information on download was in pieces at first.

**Sketches**

I was versatile in drawing essentially the digital equivalent of moving
parts on pocket-sized portrait rectangle. What was the core issue I was
there to solve? I needed to unearth it. It is always a combination of
factors that lead to an undesired outcome, rather than a holy-grail
answer?

Until know, I worked my time management musces and policed my own time
per task. I time slot per question answered. I want to have in mind a
better picture of what my contribution will be. I wanted to define the
boundaries of what I was doing. I segmented my time explicitly. I still
do that today, even.  
In my approach to boxing my time, my attention to the task was greater,
and the work improved. In meetings, I did this for myself behind the
scenes by preparing estimates of time I would take up to put an idea
forward.

My quiet time boundary plan in still in use today.

### Conclusion

In other areas of life, Its always a combination of factors that lead to
an undesired state. Working with the stakeholder to house the idea of an
onboarding ramp on to their project, I stuck to their requirements. I
did not have yet an appropriate guaging of project priorites and what
could be chalked up to and indefinate pursuit of side problem.

**Summary**

Don't get in the way of learning. Know what to leave out.

**See for yourself**
