Pros,Cons
Fast way to break down a food into its parts,Will have to scrutinized heavily.  e.g. whitelist vs blacklist restricted ingredient
"Can be a way to identify 'restriction' targets e.g dough, pizza (gluten)","May need to be left to user to approve the conversion, which may not be an safe option"
can provide for normalization of ingredients,"Amounts like ""drizzling"" etc, may not be included in a typical conversion"
Other metrics and categories can guide personalization. e.g. Produce vs Cheese,Whole recipe might have to undergo a second or more rounds of conversion
